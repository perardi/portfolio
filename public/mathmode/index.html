    <h2>The Project</h2>

    <p class="portfolio-intro"><a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/tour">Wolfram|Alpha</a> is a product that does really quite an astonishing number of things&hellip;but what users truly do with it is math. Which was an issue for growing the product&mdash;you could enter quite complex mathematical inputs, but they either had to be in “natural language”, which is frankly not that natural when trying to do an integral&hellip;</p>

    <p class="mono">integrate sin x dx from x=0 to pi</p>

    <p class="portfolio-intro">&hellip;or you could type it in Mathematica/Wolfram Language syntax, which is quite programmer-y. A 4&times;4 matrix would become&hellip;</p>

    <p class="mono">[{2, 1, 0, -3}, {3, -1, 0, 1}, {1, 4, -2, -5}]</p>

    <p class="portfolio-intro">Which is simply not user-friendly, especially for the K&ndash;12 market.</p>

    <p class="portfolio-intro">So, Math Input was developed to help users better do their job to be done.</p>

    <h2>The Goals</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>User friendly.</strong> Create an easy-to-use interface for math students to work with templates for common equations in algebra, calculus, matrices, and trigonometry.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make it pop.</strong> Give it a little visual zazz to help differentiate it from the existing functionality, and make it look less “technical” and intimidating compared to some math education products.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>School laptop friendly.</strong> Make it mobile-friendly, as much as possible, but make it <em>extremely</em> usable on smaller laptop viewports for Chromebooks for education.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Systemitize. </strong> Create a design system that keeps colors coherent and systemitized, for the existing color library has gotten rather Byzantine.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Constraints</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Domain-specific knowledge.</strong> Though I have some math education, it&rsquo;s been a while since freshman year calculus, so I had to steel myself to re-learn some of these equations and symbols. <em>(A Dirac delta function? Huh?)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Limited UX guidance.</strong> Due to a variety of team bandwidth limitations, I was responsible for signifcant UX/UI decicions, especially for mobile viewports.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mobile issues.</strong> It was important to make this work decently well on phones, and <em>very</em> well on relatively small viewport Chromebooks, to target the education market. Which is difficult, given the potential density of these equation templates.

    <h2>The Process</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Prototyping.</strong> There were so many micro-interactions and edge cases where creating a functional, high-fideilty prototype really helped clarify a lot of aspects of this design and user flow. Such as&hellip;
            <ul>
                <div class="sidebar">
                    <img src="../img/mm/sidebar.png" alt="">
                    <p>The little phone detail</p>
                </div>
                <li>
                    <strong>A little phone detail.</strong> I&rsquo;m just a bit proud of this particular detail. Navigating within templates on phones presented a lot of issues&mdash;complex templates like sums and products resulted in small, dense touch targets. I eventually landed on what I called a “dpad” in my head. A nice little affordance that makes it easy to step sequentially through a template without having to zoom &amp; tap.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Math typesetting.</strong> Showing developers how mathematical symbols, like integrals, should scale vertically by using CSS and SVGs was quite useful, and also guided the way to me providing ready-to-go SVGs for final implementation.</li>
                <li><strong>Grid layout.</strong> Using CSS grid to prototype the layout of all these various template icons helped moved things along&mdash;went through quite a few iterations of the template “keyboard” layout, and being able to quickly change some grid settings versus manual layout was much faster.</li>
                <li><strong>Animations.</strong> Crafting some CSS transitions and animations in the browser helped clarify certain transitions for both stakeholders and developers.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Utilizing corporate knowledge.</strong> Wolfram&rsquo;s primary product is called <em>Mathematica</em>. So, as one might infer: quite a few math folks on staff. Whenever a question about math would come up&mdash;the vagaries of equation typsetting, order of operations, suggestions as to icons for particular functions&mdash;I reached out for assistance from the team.
        </li>
    </ul>
