<h3 id="dates--times">Dates &amp; Times</h3>
<p>My car rental starts at <strong>noon, Friday April 8th</strong>, though I have plenty of flex time there to pick it up.</p>
<p>My car <strong>has</strong> to be back by <strong>5pm, Monday April 11</strong>, so realistically I&rsquo;ll have to pick up Bosco sometime after then.</p>
<h3 id="emergency-contact-numbers">Emergency Contact Numbers</h3>
<p>My primary contact number is:</p>
<p><strong>309-634-6862</strong></p>
<h3 id="walking-time-request">Walking Time Request</h3>
<p>Your schedule is your schedule, but he&rsquo;s used to seeing Sasha and Jackson in Margate Park there right north of the field house at <strong>noon</strong>. So if you can somehow get him out there, you then basically don&rsquo;t have to walk him, as he&rsquo;ll run around.</p>
<p>Also if he constantly stops while in the park and looks like he&rsquo;s looking for something: he&rsquo;s looking for Sasha and Jackson.</p>
<h3 id="food">Food</h3>
<p><strong>2 bags</strong> of food, <strong>twice a day</strong>.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s being a bastard about food. I put him on a diet, because I was giving him too many treats. And by &ldquo;treats&rdquo; I mean cheese. So now he seems to be protesting by not eating his kibble until the evening.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t be too alarmed. His yearly check-up was a week ago, came back flawless, and he devours treats, I think he&rsquo;s just being stubborn in the hopes I&rsquo;ll give him cheese.</p>
<h3 id="treats">Treats</h3>
<p>I usually give him one of the <strong>dental treat sticks</strong> after our morning walk.</p>
<h3 id="toys">Toys</h3>
<p>I am going to give you his orange ball, as he likes to chase that. As does Jackson.</p>
<h3 id="leash-collar-and-harness">Leash, Collar, and Harness</h3>
<p>Try not to leave his harness anywhere near chewing reach.</p>
<p>Learned that over Thanksgiving.</p>
