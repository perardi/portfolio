<p>My primary contact number is:</p>
<p><strong>309-634-6862</strong></p>
<p>However, I will be out in the sticks when I am at my parents’, and there is a small chance I won’t have cellular connectivity. If some emergency comes up <em>(which is unlikely, what could hurt this thing…)</em>, and I am not available at my primary number, try:</p>
<p><strong>309-362-2395</strong></p>
<h3 id="food">Food</h3>
<p>I’ll be providing an entire bag of Purina Pro Plan.</p>
<p>He eats…well, he should be eating <strong>4 total cups per day</strong>, or *<em>2 cups at breakfast</em> and <strong>2 cups at dinner</strong>. However I tend to bribe him with treats if I’m gone for a chunk of the day, so sometimes I scale that down.</p>
<p>Perhaps more important is the timing. He really likes to eat between 7am to 8am, and then 5pm to 6pm.</p>
