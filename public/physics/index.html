    <h2>The Project</h2>

    <p class="portfolio-intro">The <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org">Wolfram Physics Project</a> isâ€¦well, that&rsquo;s what made this a design challenge. This is a theoretical physics framework based off the CEO&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/">long-standing personal research project</a> into cellular automata. In short&hellip;in as much as I can understand it and summarize it&hellip;it is an exploration of how complex physical phenomena can evolve from relatively simple initial conditions and computational rules. <em>(<a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/">The boss summarizes it here</a>. There&rsquo;s really quite a lot of graph theory.)</em></p>

    <h2>The Goals</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Create a robust design system that allowed easy iteration and quick hand-off to developers.</li>
        <li>Craft an web-based page interface for a presentation of the ebook of this content.</li>
        <li>Design a gallery of graphs and models of cellular automata and network systems.</li>
        <li>Fashion an online file system showing the historical development of this material.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Constraints</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The project&rsquo;s content was technical. Very technical. <em>(I have a perfunctory knowledge of general & special relativity, quantum mechanics, and cosmology, but once you get to causal invariance in graph theory, I shrug epistemically.)</em></li>
        <li>
            &hellip;oh, and we started this project in March 2020. As the COVID pandemic began in earnest. That was a constraint for sure. <em>(Fortunately we were already a heavily remote work-centric company.)</em>

    <h2>The Process</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        The design of the site involved heavy use of in-browser prototyping, using a static site generator, as well as HTML/CSS/JS written by me. This allowed me to iterate rapidly based off evolving and incoming content, and produced deliverables that were immediately ready for our web team to deploy.

        <ul>
            <li>A key example: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid">CSS grid</a>. Our web team had never utilized CSS grid at all, in any capacity. But, it was extremely useful for several aspects of this site, and by providing CSS to our developers, we rapidly deployed this to the world without significant re-styling to use older techniques.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The development of the style and content presentation was a result of many, many meetings with stakeholders, including the CEO and his physics team, which required a rapid uptake of the technical material. And, as noted in the constraints, the bulk of this process took place during the initial wave of the pandemic, which, as one might imagine, necessitated flexiblity with dealing with the <em>interesting</em> nature of the time.
