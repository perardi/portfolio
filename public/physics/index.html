    <h2>The Project</h2>

    <p class="portfolio-intro">The <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org">Wolfram Physics Project</a> isâ€¦well, that&rsquo;s what made this a design challenge. This is a theoretical physics framework based off the CEO&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/">long-standing personal research project</a> into cellular automata. In short&hellip;in as much as I can understand it and summarize it&hellip;it is an exploration of how complex physical phenomena can evolve from relatively simple initial conditions and computational rules.</p> 
        
        <p class="portfolio-intro"><em>(<a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/">The boss summarizes it here</a>. There&rsquo;s really quite a lot of graph theory.)</em></p>

    <p class="portfolio-intro">This was a rapidly evolving design project to launch a signifcant web presence for this material, encompassing a wide variety of designs, including an online book, an archival materials file browser, and research gallery views.</p>

    <h2>The Goals</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Communicate.</strong> Design an attractive, vibrant site to present this physics theory, balancing the academic content with bold and colorful visuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Systematize.</strong> Create a robust design system that allowed quick hand-off to developers.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterate.</strong> Develop a design pipeline to rapidly iterate on constantly evolving incoming content.</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>The Constraints</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subject Knowledge.</strong> The project&rsquo;s content was technical. Very technical. I had to rely on fundamental design principles and the ability to research and adapt to challenging content to adapt on the fly to present the material.<a class="footie" href="#cf1">1</a></li>
        <li id="c1">
            <strong>Challenging Project Conditions.</strong> We started this project in March 2020. As the COVID pandemic began in earnest. Though we were already a heavily remote work-centric company, moving the entire workforce to work-from-home was not without friction.

    <h2>The Process</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Prototyping.</strong> The design of the site involved heavy use of in-browser prototyping, using a static site generator, as well as HTML/CSS/JS written by me. This allowed me to iterate rapidly based off evolving and incoming content, and produce deliverables that were immediately ready for our web team to deploy. Let&rsquo;s walk through how some of the key technologies helped me get this project live&hellip;

        <ul>
            <li id="c2"><strong>CSS Grid.</strong> Our web team had never utilized <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid">CSS grid</a> in any capacity. But, it was extremely useful for several aspects of this site, and by providing CSS/SCSS to our developers, we rapidly deployed this without significant re-styling and re-structuring using older techniques.<a class="footie" href="#c2">2</a></li>
            <li><strong>Variables and Well-Formed SVGs.</strong> I specifically prototyped and designed this using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS color variables</a> to keep the styles consistent throughout the site, and made sure all of my assets were SVGs with well-formed internal DOMs so we could iterate and play with colors without painful manual regeneration of every graphics asset.</li>
            <li id="c3"><strong>Static Site Generators.</strong> I leaned heavily into my <a href="https://gohugo.io">static site generator of choice</a> to create functional prototypes of complex parts of the site, including <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/archives/index/">what amounts to</a> a full web-based file browser, to help demonstrate the feasibility of such features to stakeholders and developers.<a class="footie" href="#c3">3</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Team Communication.</strong> As is somewhat obvious from my hand-waving introduction to the material, this is fairly esoteric stuff. The development of the style and content presentation was a result of many, many meetings with stakeholders, including the CEO and his physics team, which required a rapid uptake of the technical material.
    </li>

    <ul class="tangent">
        <li class="footnote" id="cf2"><a href="#c2">2</a> No. More. Floats. Ever.</li>
        <li class="footnote" id="cf3"><a href="#c3">3</a> Big fan of the Hugo static site generator&mdash;very powerful functionality that lives in a single binary, so I can have the power of a real web development framework without a leaning tower of Ruby or node.js.</li>
