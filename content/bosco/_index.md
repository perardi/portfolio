### Emergency Contact Numbers

My primary contact number is:

**309-634-6862**

However, I will be out in the sticks when I am at my parents’, and there is a small chance I won’t have cellular connectivity. If some emergency comes up *(which is unlikely, what could hurt this thing…)*, and I am not available at my primary number, try:

**309-362-2395**

### Food

I’ll be providing an entire bag of Purina Pro Plan.

He eats…well, he should be eating **4 total cups per day**, or **2 cups at breakfast* and **2 cups at dinner**. However I tend to bribe him with treats if I’m gone for a chunk of the day, so sometimes I scale that down.

Perhaps more important is the timing. He really likes to eat between 7am to 8am, and then 5pm to 6pm.

### Leash, Collar, and Harness
