# Bosco Cheat Sheet

### Dates & Times

My car rental starts at…lol, nope. My trip got cancelled.

But to take a break and shake off whatever illness I have, I will board Bosco from **Wednesday, December 22 through Monday, December 27**. 

We can have you pick him up at **10am on Wednesday**.

I will now pick him up earlier than expected on Monday, though. Like 10am.

### Emergency Contact Numbers

My primary contact number is:

**309-634-6862**

### Food

I’ll be providing an entire bag of Purina Pro Plan.

He eats…well, he should be eating **4 total cups per day**, or **2 cups at breakfast** and **2 cups at dinner**. However I tend to bribe him with treats if I’m gone for a chunk of the day, so sometimes I scale that down.

Perhaps more important is the timing. He really likes to eat between **7am to 8am**, and then **5pm to 6pm**.

### Treats

I usually give him one of the **dental treat sticks** after our morning walk.

And if he really wants more food, I give him one of the **Purina Busy Bones**. Which you’d hope would distract him for a long time, but no.

### Toys

I am going to give you his orange ball, as he likes to chase that. Or you can distract him with that if he’s a bastard.

And I'm going to throw a bone in the bag. He likes to chew on that.

### Leash, Collar, and Harness

He has had a little irritation under his arms from, seemingly, the harness, so I’ve mostly been using just a collar.

But, he’s horribly strong, and much easier to control using that harness. So by all means, use the harness. Just try to pop it off him when you get home, and if you go to the dog park, maybe have the collar and harness, and take the harness off.

Oh, and I'll be including the light-up collar. It’s easier for people to see him coming at night.
