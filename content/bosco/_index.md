# Bosco Cheat Sheet

### Dates & Times

My car rental starts at **noon, Friday April 8th**, though I have plenty of flex time there to pick it up.

My car **has** to be back by **5pm, Monday April 11**, so realistically I'll have to pick up Bosco sometime after then.

### Emergency Contact Numbers

My primary contact number is:

**309-634-6862**

### Walking Time Request

Your schedule is your schedule, but he's used to seeing Sasha and Jackson in Margate Park there right north of the field house at **noon**. So if you can somehow get him out there, you then basically don't have to walk him, as he'll run around.

Also if he constantly stops while in the park and looks like he's looking for something: he's looking for Sasha and Jackson.

### Food

**2 bags** of food, **twice a day**.

He's being a bastard about food. I put him on a diet, because I was giving him too many treats. And by "treats" I mean cheese. So now he seems to be protesting by not eating his kibble until the evening.

So don't be too alarmed. His yearly check-up was a week ago, came back flawless, and he devours treats, I think he's just being stubborn in the hopes I'll give him cheese.

### Treats

I usually give him one of the **dental treat sticks** after our morning walk.

### Toys

I am going to give you his orange ball, as he likes to chase that. As does Jackson.

### Leash, Collar, and Harness

Try not to leave his harness anywhere near chewing reach.

Learned that over Thanksgiving.
