# Bosco Cheat Sheet

### Dates & Times

### Emergency Contact Numbers

My primary contact number is:

**309-634-6862**

However, I will be out in the sticks when I am at my parents’, and there is a small chance I won’t have cellular connectivity. If some emergency comes up *(which is unlikely, what could hurt this thing…)*, and I am not available at my primary number, try:

**309-362-2395**

### Food

I’ll be providing an entire bag of Purina Pro Plan.

He eats…well, he should be eating **4 total cups per day**, or **2 cups at breakfast** and **2 cups at dinner**. However I tend to bribe him with treats if I’m gone for a chunk of the day, so sometimes I scale that down.

Perhaps more important is the timing. He really likes to eat between 7am to 8am, and then 5pm to 6pm.

### Treats & Toys

*to come…*

### Leash, Collar, and Harness

He has had a little irritation under his arms from, seemingly, the harness, so I’ve mostly been using just a collar.

But, he’s horribly strong, and much easier to control using that harness. So by all means, use the harness. Just try to pop it off him when you get home, and if you go to the dog park, maybe have the collar and harness, and take the harness off.

Oh, and I'll be including the light-up collar. It’s easier for people to see him coming at night.
